abstract = "Question Generation (QG) concerns the task of automatically generating questions from various inputs such as raw text, database, or semantic representation. People have the ability to ask deep questions about events, evaluation, opinions, synthesis, or reasons, usually in the form of Why, Why-not, How, What-if, which requires an in-depth understanding of the input source and the ability to reason over disjoint relevant contexts. Learning to ask such deep questions has broad application in future intelligent systems, such as dialog systems, online education, intelligent search, among others. This talk will introduce our recent research on generating deep questions that demand high cognitive skills, including questions that require multi-hop reasoning and questions that exhibit certain human-desired properties, such as being answerable by the passage. We will also introduce how deep question generation benefit two practical applications: multi-hop question answering, and fact verification."

**Bio:** Liangming Pan (潘亮铭) is a 4th-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore, jointly advised by Prof. Min-Yen Kan and Prof. Tat-Seng Chua. Before joining NUS, he received Master’s degree from the School of Computer Science at Tsinghua University in June 2017, working with Prof. Juanzi Li and Prof. Jie Tang. He obtained his Bachelor’s degree from Beihang University (2010 - 2014). He joined the UC Santa Barbara Natural Language Processing Group as a visiting Ph.D. student from July 2020 to May 2021, supervised by Prof. William Wang.

His broad research interests include knowledge bases, natural language processing, and data mining. To be specific, his research topics include neural question generation, quesiton answering, and text style transfer.
